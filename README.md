**About**
===========

This plugin uses special techniques to block spam bots from joining your Minecraft Server.  It blocks spammers by detecting how many players join per second (EX: 12 players join in 5 seconds).  If that statement is true, it will kick those users from your server and adds them to a autokill list.  

It has Chat Spam protection.  After a certain amount of chat messages are sent in less than x seconds, they're kicked from the server. 

It also has a legacy option to turn on a fake whitelist to prevent other users from joining the server until the specified joins per second has ran out. 

The best part? This plugin is configurable to your own hands.  If my default settings don't work for your server, change them!

**WARNING:** Expect false positives if you install the plugin if your server gets over 20 connections a minute or is really populated.

**History**
===========

This plugin was **not** created after [AntiPwnage](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/antipwnage) or [NoPwnage](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/nopwnage), this project started around 5 months ago and was a private plugin for my Minecraft Server (freebuild.me).

[s]Unfortunately, that server has died and now I have no use for this plugin because I don't really own a server anymore.  Besides, coding is something I like to do nowadays.[/s]  I'm currently in the middle of restoring it.

**What I do/Requests**
===========

The first thing that came to mind when I was writing this plugin for release, I noticed that people will find that the commands portion of the plugin may not suffice their needs of a basic Anti Pwnage plugin.  If this is the case, feel free to request it in a ticket or post a comment about it on here (However, I may miss it.  So tickets is your best option.).  I will reply to your request ASAP and see if it's a possibility or not.  It will most likely be possible to add your idea to the plugin, so request it if you can!
